## Handling Files 

### Work as an IT Specialist / Sys Admin at a medium-sized company. 

*The Human Resources Department at the company wants me to find out how many people are in each department. I need to write a Python script that reads a CSV file containing a list of the employees in the organization, counts how many people are in each department, and then generates a report using this information.*
